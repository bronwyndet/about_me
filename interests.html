    <article class="introduction">
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>Brownyn is an avid reader, motorcycle rider, parent, and geek. She recently developed an interest in baking bread after watching 'Cooked' by Michael Pollan and has her own sourdough starter living in her fridge from which she has made sourdough bread, pancakes, and rolls. She considers baking bread to be a delicious expression of the marriage of art and science!</p>
      <p>A life-long geek, each year Bronwyn attends many of the local scifi conventions including GeekGirlCon, Emerald City ComicCon, and NorWesCon. She and her daughter also enjoy attending many of the northwest's great fairs and festivals on an annual basis including Folklife, the Washington Midsummer Renaissance Faire, and the Washington State Fair (Puyallup Fair).
      <p>Bronwyn is also a published author whose poetry has appeared in publications in Boston, Dublin, and Bellingham. She has been a featured reader at poetry events in Boston, Edinburgh, Melbourne, and Dublin. She has several novels in progress and optimistically hopes that someday they might actually be finished (but in the meantime she still writes poetry which tends to be completed in a much more timely fashion).</p>
